# Mouse-2D-vibration
Data and matlab program to plot the data

Run the matlab program: tuningCurveGen.m.

It will load the data and plot the selected data. You can change what is plotted by changing the variable "structureIdx" as commented in the program. You can change the vibratory direction to either transverse or radial by changing the variable "directionIdx", which is also commented in the program.

You may use this data freely. Please reference the original paper as appropriate:
