# Mouse-2D-vibration
Data and matlab program to plot the data

Run the matlab program: tuningCurveGen.m.

It will load the data and plot the selected data. You can change what is plotted by changing the variable "structureIdx" as commented in the program. You can change the vibratory direction to either transverse or radial by changing the variable "directionIdx", which is also commented in the program.

There is also a zip file: Individual 2D datasets.zip. It contains all of of the individual datasets for the radial and transverse motion, as well as a matlab program to analyze and plot the data. Please run the program entitled "tuningCurveProc_v8.m" to do all of this.

You may use all of this data freely. Please reference the original paper as appropriate:
